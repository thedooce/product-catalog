# product-catalog

---DESCRIPTION---

This project is for Deltatre's coding challenge.

It is a single page application created with .NET Core and C# in the back-end, and Vue and TypeScript for the front-end.

The Product Catalog can be used to add new products with simple information (name, quantity, and description. 
New products are seamlessly added to the page without refreshing or reloading, and also saved to the back-end. Basic validation is performed on the name and quantity. 

---HOW TO RUN--

This project is meant to be run from within Visual Studio, but can also be ran from the command line (because it is a .NET Core application). To run, simply open the .sln file, and start debugging (usually F5).
This will open a browser window in which the page is opened.

---ABOUT---

This project was created in Visual Studio Community 2017 on a Windows 10 PC. 
I created it using the .NET Core Vue template from Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplates. They are retired, but still usable: https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/289

--NOTES--

There are 2 errors, both nested, in the project. They stem from the Vue template and they appear to be from a lack of ongoing support. They don't prevent building or running or any functionality of the SPA.
